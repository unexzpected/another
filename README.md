🐠 Mr. Fish — Enhanced Autonomous AI Agent Desktop Platform
Mr. Fish is a downloadable desktop SaaS platform that empowers users to create, manage, and execute autonomous agents across their local computer environment — from launching software to navigating files, web apps, and APIs. Designed for creators, engineers, and strategists, Mr. Fish turns your device into a fully autonomous productivity engine.
⚡ More than a dashboard — Mr. Fish gives users the option to hand over full computer use to agents.
These agents don't just run tasks – they observe, decide, and act natively within your system:
Launching and managing apps
Browsing and filtering local data
Collecting only relevant insights
Organizing information automatically
Executing workflows as if they were human operators
Product Requirements & Features
Core Objectives
Build a system that can autonomously run full multi-step workflows across the operating system.
Let users generate, retrain, and reuse intelligent agents from prompts or templates.
Provide flexible execution modes: fully autonomous, guided semi-manual, and manual assist (with optional voice-driven control).
Allow agents to natively interact with the local computer environment (apps, files, browser, APIs) and extract relevant data.
Package everything into a secure, cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) Electron desktop app for plug-and-play deployment.

Autonomous Agent Capabilities (Detailed Breakdown)
Dynamic Agent Creation & Management: The system evaluates existing agents using an intelligent scoring system (skill match, trust score, success rate, availability). If no agent exceeds a 70% fit score for a task, Mr. Fish will automatically spawn and train a new specialized agent for that task. All active agents are tracked in a registry (e.g. base agents like ABE-001, PSG-002, SIE-004, GIA-000). New agents have training datasets, models, and validation criteria auto-generated during creation.
Multi-Modal Task Processing: Agents can handle inputs and actions across text, voice, GUI, files, and web APIs. Standard task requests go through a webhook-based orchestrator (/webhook/orchestrator/task), while high-level missions trigger a “Vision” planning agent (/webhook/vision/mission) that decomposes the goal. The system can also respond to manual audit triggers via a dedicated endpoint (/webhook/audit/trigger).
Advanced Mission Planning (Vision Agent): For complex objectives, a high-level Vision Agent breaks the mission into three phases – Analysis & Planning, Implementation, and Optimization & Delivery. It then assembles a team of sub-agents specialized for each phase (analyst, planner, developer, tester, integrator, optimizer, documenter, deployer, etc.), mapping out capabilities needed and delegating tasks accordingly.
Self-Improvement Feedback Loop: Mr. Fish continuously monitors agent performance (success/failure rates, execution time, confidence scores). After each workflow, it logs outcomes and detects patterns. If an agent’s performance falls below thresholds (e.g. <90% success or frequent failures >40%), the system can retrain the agent or suggest workflow adjustments. Successful agent strategies are noted for future reuse.
Crisis Detection & Escalation: The platform includes anomaly detection to catch when an autonomous run is going awry. If an agent stalls (e.g. a task taking >5 minutes) or confidence drops <30%, or repeated failures occur, Mr. Fish will automatically escalate. It can create an incident report, notify a human via email/Slack, or switch to a safe fallback agent (a generalist problem-solver) to recover.
Self-Reflective Auditing: A scheduled self-audit runs every few hours to gather system health metrics: CPU/memory usage of agents, throughput, success rates, etc. The system identifies bottlenecks or failing agents and generates recommendations for improvement. This self-audit helps the platform “heal” itself by flagging problematic agents or workflows for retraining.
Adaptive Task Routing: When a new task comes in, Mr. Fish extracts key skill requirements and context. It intelligently selects the best-suited agent, using the scoring engine that weighs factors like prior experience with similar tasks (skill), reliability (trust), past outcome quality (success rate), and current load (availability)【15†】. If no agent is suitable enough, it resorts to creating a new one (as mentioned in #1).
Comprehensive Execution Reports: Every mission concludes with a detailed report. Mr. Fish compiles what was done by each agent, the time taken, any issues encountered, and the final QA score. If any escalations or retrains occurred, those are documented. This metadata (including system version, any enhancements used, etc.) is saved for transparency and debugging.
Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard: The UI provides real-time health and performance stats of the system – e.g. overall system health score (out of 100), current CPU/RAM usage per agent, number of API calls made, tasks completed per hour, etc. Trends are visualized to show improvements or regressions after each update.
Enterprise Integration Ready: Mr. Fish is built on a webhook-driven architecture (RESTful APIs), making it easy to integrate with enterprise tools. It can send notifications or results to external systems. For example, it can create tickets in Jira or send Slack/Teams alerts if human review is needed. Critical failures can trigger a pager notification.
Robust Error Handling: The agents produce contextual error messages and have retry mechanisms for transient failures. If a specialized agent fails, the orchestrator can gracefully hand the task to a general fallback agent to ensure continuity. There are safeguards so that if one agent crashes, it doesn’t bring down the whole system (each agent runs in isolation, possibly in its own process or container).
Resource Optimization: The platform uses performance benchmarking to keep resource usage efficient. For instance, lighter-weight AI models or cached results are used where possible. Agents unload from memory when idle. Tasks are load-balanced among agents if multiple can handle them. This ensures Mr. Fish can run continuously without hogging system resources.
Unique Differentiators
Truly Autonomous: Mr. Fish doesn’t just follow pre-scripted tasks; it can generate new agents and new plans on its own, without human intervention, to tackle novel problems.
Self-Healing: The system automatically detects issues (stalls, errors, low-quality output) and takes corrective action, retraining or switching strategies on the fly.
Mission-Aware: It understands high-level goals and breaks them down, coordinating multiple agents and steps to accomplish an overall mission rather than just single tasks.
Continuously Learning: Agents improve over time via feedback loops, and the system as a whole gets smarter with each task, recognizing successful patterns and applying them.
Enterprise-Ready: Built-in support for notifications, logging, security controls, and extensibility (plugin-like agent marketplace) makes it suitable for professional and enterprise environments.
System Modes
Mr. Fish can operate in several user-selectable modes of assistance:
Mode
Functionality
Autonomous
Full AI execution of workflows from start to finish (hands-off).
Semi-Manual
Agent works step-by-step, pausing to guide the user or ask for approval at key points (assistant-like).
Manual Assist
Agent provides instructions and suggestions, but the user executes the steps themselves (like an expert advisor).
Voice Activated
Voice command mode with a push-to-talk toggle for hands-free operation.

Users can switch between modes, for example starting in Semi-Manual to observe and then toggling to Autonomous once comfortable. Voice mode can overlay on any of the above, allowing spoken input instead of typing commands.
System Architecture
The application is delivered as an Electron-based desktop app (for cross-platform compatibility). It follows a modular client-server architecture:
Frontend: A desktop GUI (built in either Svelte or React + Vite) that displays agent status, logs, and controls. This includes a dashboard view and an overlay interface (similar to screen-sharing controls in Teams/Zoom or the Cluely agent carousel style) where you can see what the agent is doing. A microphone button (🎤) on the UI allows toggling voice capture (either push-to-talk or continuous listen mode).
Backend: A local server (FastAPI in Python or Express in Node.js) that houses the core logic – agent management, prompt optimization (Lyra engine), and the task orchestration router. The backend exposes API endpoints (webhooks) that the frontend calls for issuing tasks and receiving status updates.
Agents: Each agent is a distinct module (could be separate process or thread) encapsulating a specific skill set. Agents might run sandboxed, e.g. in containers or with restricted OS permissions, especially when performing risky operations. They have access to the local system through controlled interfaces provided by the backend (for example, a file system module, an app controller module for launching apps, etc.).
Database: Agent configurations, learned data, and workflow history are stored in a local database (SQLite for simplicity in MVP, with option to use PostgreSQL for multi-user or cloud setups). This registry keeps track of agent metadata, performance stats, and saved workflows.
External Integrations: Mr. Fish can connect to external services (like Gmail, Slack, Jira, Notion, etc.) via API keys stored securely in environment variables. Integration modules or plugins handle these external API interactions when agents need them.
The repository is organized as follows:

Note: The frontend is set up using React + Vite by default in this project (to leverage the React ecosystem and fast build). However, the UI could be implemented in Svelte for a more lightweight approach if desired – the structure above supports either. The Electron wrapper ties the frontend and backend together into a single desktop application. Using Electron ensures the app runs on Windows and macOS (the primary targets for MVP testing), as well as Linux.
Security Considerations
Security is critical since these agents can control the computer. Key measures include:
Environment Secrets: All API keys and sensitive credentials are stored in a .env file (or OS keychain) and never hard-coded. The repository’s .gitignore is configured to exclude secrets. For example:
gitignore
CopyEdit


*.env  
/secrets/  
api_keys.py  



(This prevents accidental commits of secrets. ⚠️ Never push your .env or API keys to GitHub. Use GitHub encrypted secrets or environment variables for deployments.)
Role-Based Access: Internal functions that perform system operations are gated by permission checks. Agents are only allowed to call OS-level functions that their role requires (principle of least privilege). For instance, a web-scraper agent won’t have file delete permissions.
Sandboxing: Wherever possible, agents run in isolated environments. For example, an agent launching external applications could be run in a container or a restricted user account, to contain its access.
Automatic Memory Wipe: Agents unload data from memory after tasks (especially any sensitive data) if they go idle, to reduce the risk of lingering sensitive info in RAM.
Idle Timeout & Shutdown: If the system is left running with autonomous agents, an inactivity timer will put agents to sleep or shut them down after a period of no tasks, as a safety measure.

(Status Key: ✅ implemented; ⚙️ in progress/planned for MVP)
Day-One Goals (Setup Tasks)
Create Electron wrapper: Initialize the Electron application structure that will load the front-end and manage the back-end process.
Set up the Backend: Establish a simple API server (FastAPI or Express) with endpoints for starting tasks, retrieving status, etc. This includes hooking up a basic orchestrator and a couple of example agents.
Set up the Frontend: Implement a basic React (or Svelte) app that can send user prompts to the backend and display responses. Include UI elements for mode switching and voice input.
Dockerize the system: Write a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to containerize the app for consistency across development environments.
Connect a Database: Initialize a lightweight database (SQLite for development) to store agent data and logs (the agent registry and workflow history).
Feature Implementation Plan
Agent Creation & Training: Enable the user to define a new agent via prompt or template. Implement the scoring system so that when a task comes in, if no agent’s score ≥ 70%, trigger the creation of a new agent. Include a basic training routine (could be as simple as fine-tuning on a few examples or setting up initial context).
Lyra Optimizer Engine: Integrate the Lyra dual-prompt optimization before agent execution. This means when a user enters a task, call the Lyra module to refine the prompt (twice). (Lyra’s logic, as described, should be implemented or stubbed: e.g., it might be a function that reformats the prompt according to best practices.)
Execution Router: Build the task router that accepts the optimized prompt, consults the Vision Agent (if complex mission) to break it into subtasks/phases, and assigns those to agents. For MVP, this could be simplified to a direct agent call if one agent can handle it, but structure the code to allow the multi-phase expansion later.
QA & Feedback Loop: After an agent completes a task, compute a simple QA score (this could be as basic as checking if the desired output file exists, or using a heuristic). If the score is below a threshold (say 90%), log that and mark for potential retraining. (In MVP, retraining might be manual or simulated due to time constraints.)
Voice Mode: Integrate a speech-to-text library (OpenAI’s Whisper is recommended for accuracy; Vosk is an alternative for offline speed). MVP goal: allow the user to click the mic, speak a command, and have it transcribed and fed into the system as the task prompt. Basic NLP can interpret simple commands (or you can directly use the transcribed text as if it was typed).
Dashboard UI with Live Status: Develop a minimal interface showing the progress of agent tasks (could just be a log output or step list updating in real-time). Also include controls to switch mode (Auto/Semi/Manual) before or during a run, and a voice toggle button.
Agent App Store (v1): Set up the framework for an internal marketplace of agents. For MVP, this could be just a section in the UI listing the example agents (from the examples/ directory) that come bundled, allowing the user to activate them. Full upload/download features can be slated for later, but design the section with future expansion in mind.
Prebuilt Agent Templates to Include
As part of the MVP, several example agent workflows will be provided to showcase capabilities and serve as templates for users to build from. These include:
🏠 Interior Design Agent: Uses Blender (or a 3D rendering API) to create room designs from descriptions (as seen in the Gmail → Interior Design example). Incorporates sourcing of furniture ideas from the web.
🎬 Video Editing Agent: Automates editing in Adobe Premiere or a similar tool – for example, cutting a raw video into a final clip with music and transitions, given some criteria.
📱 App Development Agent: Scaffolds a simple web application (e.g., a Next.js frontend with an Express or FastAPI backend) from a prompt describing the app idea. This agent writes code, sets up a local server, and maybe even deploys it.
🧵 Clothing Design Agent: Takes a fashion sketch or concept and generates a clothing design prototype. For MVP this might integrate with a tool like Figma or an AI image generator to visualize garments.
🌐 Website Launch Agent: Turns a prompt into a live website. It could generate static HTML/CSS or use a framework, then deploy to a platform (maybe utilizing a service like GitHub Pages or Vercel for demonstration).
📈 Marketing Automation Agent: Posts content to a social media or blog platform, then tracks engagement. It can be scheduled to run periodically, analyze basic analytics, and adjust the content strategy (perhaps by choosing different keywords or posting times).
Each template agent will reside in the examples/ directory with a JSON manifest (describing the workflow and any special parameters) and script logic. These serve both as useful tools out-of-the-box and as sample code for developers to create new agents.
Developer Roadmap (Post-MVP)
Looking beyond the MVP, the following features are on the roadmap to further enhance Mr. Fish:
Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder: A visual editor (WYSIWYG) to let users graphically arrange and customize agent workflows and decision branches without coding.
Cross-Agent Memory Syncing: A shared memory or knowledge base that multiple agents can access and contribute to, enabling them to learn from each other’s experiences and collaborate on tasks.
Multi-User Collaboration: Support for multiple user accounts or a cloud service where a team can use Mr. Fish collaboratively, with shared agents and workflows (introducing permissions, versioning, etc.).
Browser & Email Integration Plugins: Secure browser extensions and email plugins (for services like Gmail, Outlook) so that agents can directly read email or web content with user authorization, enabling more seamless data access during workflows.
Global Agent Marketplace: An online marketplace where users can publish agents they’ve created and download/rate others’ agents. This would include tags, categories, and reviews to easily find the right agent for a task.
Enhanced Voice Interaction: A more fine-tuned voice assistant mode where the AI responds via speech, can handle continuous conversations, and falls back to command-line control if voice input fails. This includes improving voice-agent responsiveness and accuracy, and possibly integration with smart speakers.
Fine-Grained Access Control: More advanced security roles and possibly an admin console for enterprise use, allowing organizations to define what system resources each agent can access and auditing all actions.
Improved Performance & Scaling: Optimizing the system to handle concurrent tasks and scaling the architecture for heavier workflows (possibly offloading some AI computations to cloud services or utilizing GPUs if available).
Advanced Use Case Scenarios (Across Verticals)
To illustrate the long-term potential of Mr. Fish, here are ten game-changing scenarios across different industries. These go beyond the MVP to show what fully realized autonomous agents could accomplish:
🧠 Software Development & SaaS Operations
Use Case: An agent takes a feature request from a ticket (e.g., Jira or Slack) and autonomously delivers a complete update to a software project. It reads the spec, plans the architecture, creates a new Git branch, writes and tests code for frontend and backend, sets up the database if needed, integrates APIs, deploys the update to a platform like Vercel or AWS, updates documentation, and even posts release notes.
✅ Syncs with version control (GitHub), documentation tools (Notion), API collections (Postman), and database services (e.g., Supabase).
✅ Monitors for bug reports after deployment, then automatically creates patches or rollbacks and retrains itself based on failure patterns.
🏠 Interior Design & 3D Rendering
Use Case: A client emails room dimensions, budget, and style preferences. The agent logs into the user’s Gmail to get the details, then launches a 3D design program like Blender (or uses an AI like RoomGPT) to draft a room layout. It selects furniture from online catalogs (Wayfair/IKEA) within budget, generates a rendered visualization, and compiles a shopping list. If the initial design is judged subpar (e.g., via a low QA rating or client feedback), the agent iterates – adjusting the layout or style and retraining its design model to better fit the client’s preferences.
✅ Incorporates QA feedback and sourcing logic (ensuring the proposed items are in stock and meet budget/size constraints).
✅ Provides real-time updates or options to the client for feedback and optimizes the design based on their reactions.
💼 B2B Prospecting Engine
Use Case: A startup founder provides their pitch deck and an ideal customer profile. The agent analyzes the product and value proposition, then scours LinkedIn and CRM databases (like Apollo) to build a list of potential clients. It drafts personalized cold emails for each prospect, sends them out, monitors replies, and updates a CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot) with the interactions. The agent adjusts the outreach strategy based on response rates – for example, altering email copy if it detects poor engagement. It can even schedule follow-up meetings by integrating with Calendly when it gets positive replies.
✅ Uses GPT-4 or similar for generating personalized outreach content based on each prospect’s profile.
✅ Automates follow-ups and meeting scheduling, creating calendar events when a prospect is interested.
🎬 AI Movie Generator
Use Case: A user inputs a prompt: "Create a 90-minute sci-fi thriller in the style of Jordan Peele, with cinematography like Roger Deakins." The agent then writes a screenplay, storyboards scenes using image generators (Midjourney for style frames), generates synthetic voice lines for dialogue, and assembles video clips using tools like Runway ML for effects and editing in a Wes Anderson-esque tone. It produces a final edited film and even a trailer for promotion.
✅ Handles full production pipeline: scripting, scene visualization, video editing, and sound mixing – entirely with AI tools.
✅ Can gather feedback from sample audiences (perhaps via a survey link) and retrain or re-edit the film for better pacing or clarity based on the feedback.
🛒 E-commerce Startup Launch
Use Case: The user describes a product idea (for example, a new kind of smart home gadget). The agent conducts market research by scraping forums (Reddit threads, Amazon reviews of similar products) to identify pain points and desired features. It then finds potential suppliers on Alibaba, negotiates sample orders, builds an online store (Shopify), writes product descriptions with SEO keywords, and sets up online ads (Google Ads/Facebook). It also establishes analytics tracking (Google Analytics) to monitor traffic. All of this happens with minimal user intervention, effectively launching an e-commerce business overnight.
✅ Iteratively optimizes the store’s conversion rate by analyzing user behavior and tweaking the site design/content.
✅ Monitors profit margins and ad spend, and can pause campaigns or reorder inventory automatically based on performance.
📚 Course & Education Empire Builder
Use Case: A teacher provides raw material (text notes or a recorded lecture). The agent transforms this into a full online course: it structures the curriculum into sections/modules, writes up lesson content, creates slide decks, and even generates quiz questions. For video content, it can use AI avatar generators (e.g., Synthesia) to produce lecture videos of a realistic instructor delivering the material, complete with subtitles. It builds a landing page for the course on Teachable or Gumroad and implements an email marketing funnel.
✅ Utilizes speech-to-text (Whisper) to transcribe lectures, and text-to-speech or avatar tech to create engaging video lectures.
✅ Automatically adds subtitles and can translate/localize content into multiple languages to widen the course’s reach.
🧑‍⚕️ Personal Health & Wellness Advisor
Use Case: The user connects their fitness wearable data and diet logging app. The agent aggregates data from a smartwatch (heart rate, sleep patterns), MyFitnessPal (nutrition), and other inputs to create a tailored 3-month health plan. It generates daily workout routines (with YouTube exercise links or custom-generated exercise GIFs), meal plans and shopping lists, and sends daily encouragement or tips via text or voice. It adjusts the plan weekly based on progress reports and mood logs the user keeps.
✅ Retrains its recommendations each week, for example increasing workout intensity if the user’s recovery improves, or adjusting calorie targets if weight change stalls.
✅ Issues alerts for health anomalies (e.g., if it detects potentially dangerous patterns in heart rate or sleep, it will notify the user or a health professional contact).
🕹️ Game Studio-in-a-Box
Use Case: A game designer speaks out a new game concept (genre, story, mechanics). The agent uses this to generate all aspects of a playable game prototype. It creates character models and assets (perhaps using Blender or Unity with AI-generated textures), writes code for game mechanics, generates music and sound effects (with AI music tools), and builds levels. It then packages the game and publishes it to a platform like itch.io for players to test.
✅ Sets up continuous integration – if the designer gives feedback or new ideas, the agent updates the game, balancing gameplay elements based on player feedback telemetry.
✅ Continuously refines game mechanics (e.g., adjusting difficulty) by analyzing how players interact with the game, aiming for an optimal player experience.
🧾 Legal Assistant for Entrepreneurs
Use Case: A founder needs various legal documents and filings for a new company. The agent gathers the necessary information about the business (location, structure, etc.) through a Q&A with the user, then generates customized documents: NDAs, Operating Agreements, contractor contracts, etc., using legal templates and GPT-trained on legal texts. It files for business registration/incorporation online in the user’s state/country, submits trademark or patent applications if needed, and sets up reminders for compliance deadlines (annual reports, tax filings).
✅ Checks all documents against local jurisdiction rules (possibly via an API or a knowledge base of regulations) to ensure they are compliant.
✅ Monitors legal changes or upcoming law modifications in the relevant domain and alerts the user if any company documents need updating.
🏢 Full Company Ops Agent (BizOps Copilot)
Use Case: A CEO describes their business goals and current pain points in a strategy session. The agent acts as a BizOps team: it analyzes company data (financials, KPIs from spreadsheets or databases), generates dashboards of key metrics, and identifies trends or issues (e.g., rising customer churn). It then automates routine reports to staff, drafts strategy memos, and suggests operational changes (like cost-cutting or hiring plans) to meet the stated goals. It can also manage calendars and coordinate meetings if structural changes are recommended.
✅ Produces financial models and forecasts (cash flow, revenue projections) and updates them continuously as new data comes in.
✅ Recommends organizational adjustments (for example, suggesting to hire a certain role or reorganize a team) based on performance analysis and can even draft job descriptions or org charts to support its recommendations.
Developer Setup & Usage (README)
Installation
Begin by cloning the repository and installing dependencies:
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mrfish.git  
cd mrfish  
npm install        # Install frontend/backend dependencies (for a Node/Express backend)  
# If using Python for backend:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
docker build -t mrfish .   # (Optional) Build Docker image for the app
Note: Ensure you have all necessary environment variables set up. Copy or rename the provided .env.example to .env and fill in API keys (if any) for services you plan to use (e.g., OpenAI API key for certain agents). Do not commit this .env or any secrets to version control.
If you intend to use voice features, make sure to install a speech-to-text engine. By default, Mr. Fish is configured to use OpenAI Whisper for high-accuracy transcription (you’ll need an OpenAI API key or a local Whisper model). Alternatively, you can integrate an offline library like Vosk for faster, local speech recognition. Install and configure these before running voice mode.
Launch & Usage
After installation, you can launch the application. In development, you will run the frontend, backend, and Electron wrapper:
bash
CopyEdit
# Start the frontend (development server)
npm run dev
# Start the backend server 
npm run backend    # (For Python FastAPI, run `uvicorn app:app` or `python app.py` accordingly)
# In a separate terminal, launch the Electron app
npm run electron
Alternatively, using Docker:
bash
CopyEdit
docker-compose up
This will start all necessary components in containers (ensure you configured the docker-compose.yml for your environment).
Once Mr. Fish is running, you will see the desktop application window:
Basic Usage Workflow:
Launch the app – The Electron app opens a window that serves as the dashboard.
Enable voice (optional) – If you plan to use voice input, click the 🎤 Voice Toggle button. This can function as push-to-talk (hold to speak) or a toggle (click on/off) depending on settings. When active, the button indicates listening mode and your speech will be transcribed.
Enter a task – Type your request in the prompt input field (or speak it, if voice mode is on). For example, "Create a summary of the latest design document and email it to the team."
Prompt optimization – When you submit the task, the Lyra module will automatically refine your prompt in two passes. You might briefly see the optimized prompt versions displayed or logged (this step is usually quick). This ensures the task is clearly defined for the agents.
Choose execution mode – If you have set Mr. Fish to ask for mode per task, it will prompt you to choose the mode (Autonomous, Semi-Manual, or Manual Assist). In Autonomous mode, the agent network proceeds to handle the task completely. In Semi-Manual, you’ll get prompted at decision points to confirm or provide input. In Manual Assist, the system will simply outline what steps you should do. (You can set a default mode in settings to skip this step if desired.)
Agent execution – The agents will now carry out the task. You can follow along in the UI: the task visualizer will show each subtask or phase being executed (for example: "Reading Gmail... ✔️", "Launching Blender... ✔️", "Designing 3D model... ⏳"). Logs or any output from agents will appear in the console panel in real time.
Results and feedback – Once the workflow is complete, the results are displayed. If it was a document or file, Mr. Fish will show a link or open the file. You’ll also see a QA score or success indicator for the task. In Autonomous mode, if the score was low, the system might have already retried or retrained behind the scenes – this will be noted in the log ("Retrying with adjusted approach...").
Save or refine – You can save the workflow as a reusable agent if it’s something you'll do often (the UI provides an option to save the assembled agent and its prompt sequence as a template). If the outcome wasn’t what you wanted, you can provide feedback. In Semi-Manual mode, you might have adjusted steps along the way, and the agent learns from those adjustments. Over time, this feedback loop helps improve performance.
During a task, you can pause or stop the execution at any time (there’s a pause/stop button in the UI) — for instance, if an agent is taking too long or if you realize you need to correct the prompt. In Semi-Manual mode, the system will naturally pause for your confirmation at each step.
Troubleshooting & Logging
All actions are logged in the logs/ directory (or a log panel in the app). If something goes wrong or an agent behaves unexpectedly, check the logs for error messages and context. Common issues during development might include missing environment permissions (e.g., the agent trying to open an app that requires additional OS permissions) or missing API keys for third-party integrations. The system will log contextual error messages to help debug these.
Updating Agents and Workflows
Developers can modify agent scripts in the backend/agents/ folder. After editing or adding an agent, you may need to restart the backend for changes to take effect. The front-end will automatically refresh if using the dev server.
Contributing
❤️ Contributing: We welcome contributions to make Mr. Fish even better. If you're an engineer or creator, you can contribute in many ways:
New Agent Types: Add specialized agents (and example workflows) for new domains. For instance, perhaps a Music Composition Agent or a Medical Research Agent. Include a manifest and any integration requirements in the examples/ folder.

Executing multi-step workflows as if they were human operators


By combining domain-specific AI skills, an open plugin-like ecosystem, and robust developer tools, Mr. Fish can potentially automate roles that traditionally require highly paid experts (e.g. tax accounting, medical billing, compliance review). In essence, it’s an AI operating system for orchestrating specialized agents that tackle high-value, repetitive jobs autonomously.

🎯 Core Objectives
End-to-End Autonomy: Build a system that can autonomously run full multi-step workflows across the operating system (OS) without human intervention.


Agent Lifecycle Management: Enable users (or the system itself) to generate new intelligent agents on the fly (from prompts or templates), retrain them with new data, and reuse or tweak them for future tasks.


Flexible Execution Modes: Provide multiple modes of operation – from fully autonomous runs to guided, step-by-step assistance (semi-manual), to manual instruction mode where the agent only advises. Voice-driven control should be supported for hands-free operation.


Native OS Integration: Allow agents to natively interact with the local computer environment with appropriate permissions – this includes launching software, controlling GUIs, reading/writing files, using the web and APIs – essentially performing tasks exactly as a human user would on the machine.


Secure, Cross-Platform Deployment: Package the entire system into a secure, cross-platform desktop application (Windows, macOS, Linux via Electron) for plug-and-play use. Security controls must ensure safe operation given the high level of system access (no unauthorized actions or data leaks).


High-Value Task Automation: Target automation of complex, high-value tasks (the kind of work associated with $100K+/year knowledge jobs). The platform should be capable of handling intensive roles such as software development, tax accounting, compliance auditing, design generation, content creation, etc., through specialized agents.


Open Ecosystem & Extensibility: Create an open infrastructure for AI agents – including an internal “app store” for sharing agents, standardized memory/storage for agent knowledge, and developer tools for monitoring and scaling agent deployments. This encourages community-driven extensions and vertical-specific agents from day one.


Developer & Enterprise Friendly: Provide robust developer tools (APIs, logging, testing sandbox, agent management UI) so developers can build and supervise agent teams at scale. Ensure the system can integrate into enterprise workflows (e.g. sending notifications, connecting to enterprise data sources, respecting privacy constraints).



🚀 Example Use Cases
To illustrate Mr. Fish’s versatility, here are some use cases spanning creative, technical, and business domains. Each showcases an autonomous workflow that the platform could handle:
Use Case
Description
🏠 Email → Interior Design
Reads a client’s email request, opens a 3D design tool (e.g. Blender), and creates a room design based on provided dimensions, style, and budget. The agent performs quality checks, iterates on the design as needed, and emails back a final rendered image and shopping list.
🎬 Raw Video → Edited Content
Takes raw video footage and autonomously edits it into a final cut. The agent trims clips, adds transitions and music, synchronizes audio, and renders the video, ready for upload on a schedule. It can iterate based on viewer feedback in subsequent runs.
📱 Idea → App Prototype
From a plain language prompt describing an app idea, the agent generates a simple MVP: it scaffolds a frontend and backend (e.g. a Next.js web app with an Express API), sets up a database, writes code for key features, and even deploys it to a cloud service.
🧵 Sketch → Fashion Line
Ingests hand-drawn fashion sketches or descriptions and produces 3D clothing designs. The agent uses CAD or fashion design software to create garment patterns, generates realistic mockups, and compiles manufacturer-ready specification sheets for each design.
🌐 Prompt → Live Website
Takes a user’s website description and goes through the steps to build and launch it. This includes creating a wireframe, converting it to HTML/CSS/JS code, implementing content, and deploying the site (for example on Vercel or GitHub Pages) – all automatically.
📈 Auto-Marketer Loop
Acts as a digital marketing assistant that periodically creates and publishes content (social media posts, blog articles), monitors engagement analytics, and adjusts the strategy in a feedback loop. For instance, it might A/B test different post times or styles and learn what yields better engagement over time.
🧠 Deep Work Research Assistant
Gathers information from local documents, PDFs, emails, and web sources to produce a cohesive report or summary. For example, “Summarize all project-related emails and files from this month and draft a status update” – the agent will search through local data, compile key points, and generate a summary document.
🧾 Accounting & Compliance
(Future) Connects to financial software and databases to perform routine accounting tasks or compliance checks. The agent could prepare a draft tax filing by pulling transaction data, cross-check compliance rules or regulations, and flag any issues for human review, effectively functioning as a junior accountant.

(Mr. Fish’s flexibility allows it to operate across many domains — these are just a few examples of high-value workflows it can automate.)

🧩 Key Feature Modules (v2.0)
Mr. Fish consists of several integrated modules that together enable autonomous operation. Version 2.0 focuses on the following core features:
✅ Agent Lifecycle Manager: Create, archive, configure, and reuse agents on demand. Users can spin up new agents from a prompt or template and deactivate or retrain them as needed. The system also automatically manages agents based on performance (spawning new ones if required).


✅ Enhanced Execution Router: An intelligent task router that receives user requests and breaks them into tasks, then assigns each task to the best-fit agent using a scoring logic. It ensures each sub-task is handled by the agent with the most relevant expertise available.


✅ Lyra Dual-Prompt Optimizer: A two-pass prompt optimization engine (“Lyra”) that refines user prompts before agent execution. It deconstructs the user’s request, clarifies ambiguities, adds context, and reformulates it to maximize understanding and result quality from the AI agents.


✅ Flexible Autonomy Modes: Multiple operation modes are supported – fully autonomous (the agent proceeds without interruption), semi-manual (the agent pauses for user approval or input at key steps), manual assist (the agent only provides instructions for the user to execute), and a voice-driven mode for hands-free control. Users can switch modes on the fly.


✅ QA Scoring & Feedback Loop: Built-in quality assurance that evaluates results of each task (e.g., using heuristics or a discriminator model to score outcome quality 0–100%). If the quality is below a threshold, the system can automatically trigger improvements: iterating the task, retraining the agent responsible, or adjusting the plan. Successful results are logged as new training data.


✅ Minimal Dashboard UI: A simple but informative graphical interface to monitor and control agents. It shows live agent activity, task progress, and status updates in real-time. The UI includes an overlay panel (similar to a screen-sharing or meeting assistant) where you can see what the agent is doing on your system and intervene if necessary.


✅ Local System Control: Agents can directly interact with the local OS with user permission. For example, an agent can open and manipulate applications (like a browser or Excel), navigate the file system, copy files, or call local APIs. This native control is sandboxed and logged for security but allows deep integration – the agent essentially uses the computer as a human would.


✅ Agent Marketplace (App Store): A built-in marketplace interface to import, share, or download community-made agents and workflows. Users can browse curated agent templates or publish their own agents for others. This encourages an ecosystem of vertical AI agents specialized by domain or task (design, coding, marketing, etc.), accelerating development of new capabilities.


✅ Workflow Templates: Users can save and reuse entire task workflows. Common or complex workflows can be packaged as templates (possibly represented in JSON or script form) that chain multiple agents and steps. The system will ship with some predefined workflow templates (for instance, the examples above) so users can get started quickly or build upon them.


⚙️ System Modes
Mr. Fish supports several modes of operation to suit different comfort levels and use cases. The user can choose the mode when initiating a task or switch mid-task if needed:
Mode
Functionality
Autonomous
Full AI execution of the workflow from start to finish. The agent (or team of agents) will not stop for confirmation – it carries out the entire task autonomously. Ideal for well-defined, repetitive tasks or when you trust the agent.
Semi-Manual
The agent runs step-by-step, pausing for user approval or guidance at key decision points. This is like having an assistant that checks in with you – useful for oversight on critical tasks.
Manual Assist
The agent doesn’t execute actions directly, but provides instructions, suggestions, or scripts for the user to execute. Acts like an expert advisor or step-by-step guide. Good for learning or when full automation is not desired.
Voice Activated
A layer on top of the above modes: control the system via voice commands. In voice mode, the user can speak requests and responses. The microphone can be push-to-talk or toggled always-listening. Voice mode works in tandem with either autonomous, semi-manual, or manual assist behavior, allowing hands-free operation.

(Example workflow: A user might start in Semi-Manual mode to watch how the agent works through a task, then switch to Autonomous mode once confident. Voice mode can be enabled at any time to allow speaking the next command or asking follow-up questions.)

🏗️ System Architecture
Mr. Fish is delivered as an Electron-based desktop application for cross-platform support. Under the hood, it’s organized into a modular client-server architecture, split into distinct components:
Frontend (UI): A desktop GUI built with modern web technology (React + Vite or Svelte). This provides the dashboard, real-time visualizations of agent activities, logs, and controls (mode toggles, voice input button, etc.). The UI can also present an overlay view showing what the agent is doing on screen (similar to a translucent screen-share control or the Cluely AI assistant style overlay).


Backend Server: A local server (could be FastAPI in Python or Express in Node.js) that runs the core logic. This includes the agent orchestration engine, the Lyra prompt optimizer, and all agent management routines. The backend exposes internal API endpoints (webhooks) that agents and the frontend use to communicate (e.g. /webhook/orchestrator/task for submitting tasks, /webhook/vision/mission for mission planning, etc.). The backend is essentially the brain coordinating all agents and tasks.


Agents: Each agent is a distinct process or module, encapsulating a specific skill set or role. Agents could be run as separate processes or sandboxed containers for safety (especially if they execute untrusted code). They have controlled access to the system via the backend’s interfaces – for example, an agent requests the backend to open a file or launch an app, and the backend mediates that action (applying permission checks). Agents can be based on different AI models or scripts specialized in their domain (e.g., a coding agent, a design agent, a writing agent).


Database/Storage: A local database (SQLite for MVP, potentially PostgreSQL for scaling or multi-user scenarios) stores agent configurations, training data, and logs. This Agent Registry keeps track of all available agents, their capabilities, performance metrics, and past task results. It also stores saved workflows, user preferences, and any cached knowledge (shared memory) that agents might utilize.


External Integrations: Mr. Fish can integrate with external services and APIs to extend its reach. Integration modules (plugins) handle connecting to email (Gmail API), project management (Jira), messaging (Slack/Teams), cloud services, etc. API keys or OAuth tokens for these are stored securely (never hard-coded). This allows agents to pull data or trigger actions beyond the local machine (for example, creating a ticket in Jira or sending an email as part of a workflow).


The high-level architecture separates concerns: the frontend ensures usability and oversight, the backend manages logic and state, and agents perform the heavy-lifted domain-specific tasks, all while maintaining secure boundaries.

(Note: The UI is prototyped in React for MVP, but could be swapped with Svelte for a lighter footprint if needed. Electron ties the frontend and backend together into one app. This structure supports easy packaging into a desktop app while maintaining separation of concerns.)

🤖 Autonomous Agent Capabilities (Detailed Breakdown)
Mr. Fish’s agents and orchestrator incorporate advanced capabilities to enable true autonomy. Below are key features and mechanisms in the system, organized by category:
🚀 Core Autonomous Features
Dynamic Agent Creation & Management: The system maintains a roster of available agents and uses an intelligent scoring system to evaluate them for new tasks. The scoring considers skill match to the task (based on the agent’s training/specialty), the agent’s trust/reliability score (past performance), success rate on similar tasks, and current load/availability. If no existing agent has a sufficient score (e.g. ≥70% fit) for a task, Mr. Fish automatically creates a new specialized agent on the fly. New agents are trained using auto-generated datasets or context relevant to the task, and are assigned an ID (e.g., ABE-001, PSG-002, etc.) and tracked in the registry. This dynamic spawning allows the system to tackle novel problems without human intervention.


Multi-Modal Task Processing: Agents can seamlessly handle different input and output modalities and interface with various tools. For example, an agent can process text instructions, click GUI elements, take voice input or produce spoken output, manipulate images or design files, and call APIs/web services. The orchestrator uses different pipelines depending on the request: a standard task goes through a normal task pipeline (/webhook/orchestrator/task), whereas a complex multi-objective mission triggers a special Vision Planner pipeline (/webhook/vision/mission) that breaks the goal into sub-tasks. The system can also respond to manual audit triggers via an endpoint (/webhook/audit/trigger) to allow a user or external system to inspect or adjust an ongoing process.


Advanced Mission Planning (Vision Agent): For particularly complex or high-level objectives, a top-level Vision Agent kicks in to perform mission planning. This agent analyzes the goal and devises a plan broken into three broad phases – Analysis & Planning, Implementation, and Optimization & Delivery. It then selects or spawns a team of specialized sub-agents for each phase: e.g. an analyst to research requirements, a planner to outline tasks, developers to build solutions, testers for QA, an integrator to assemble components, an optimizer to refine the outcome, a documenter to prepare reports, and a deployer to deliver the final result. The Vision Agent coordinates these roles, effectively acting as a project manager that maps out required capabilities and ensures each phase’s agents work together.


🔄 Self-Improvement Mechanisms
Agent Feedback Loop & Self-Training: Mr. Fish continuously monitors agent performance and outcomes. After each task or workflow execution, it logs success/failure, execution time, and a confidence or quality score of the result. If an agent’s performance starts to lag (e.g., success rate drops below 90% or it frequently fails on certain steps), the system can automatically trigger a retraining or optimization of that agent. The platform identifies patterns from past successful runs and failures – for instance, noticing that agents using a particular strategy complete tasks faster – and uses these insights to recommend improvements. In some cases, the orchestrator might create a new agent to compete or collaborate with an underperforming one, gradually phasing out approaches that don’t work well.


Crisis Detection & Escalation: Robust anomaly detection is built-in to catch when a workflow is going wrong. If an agent gets stuck (e.g., a subtask taking excessively long, say >5 minutes without progress), or the agent’s confidence in its action falls below a safe threshold (e.g. <30%), or repeated errors occur, Mr. Fish will automatically escalate the issue. Escalation can take multiple forms: the system could generate an incident report and notify a human operator via email or Slack (with details of what went wrong), or it could switch to a safe fallback procedure (for example, handing control to a more general-purpose “emergency recovery” agent or pausing for manual input). This ensures that misbehaving agents don’t cause havoc – there’s always a safety net that stops and calls for help when needed.


Self-Reflective Auditing: Every few hours (configurable, e.g. every 4 hours), the platform performs a self-audit. This background process gathers system health metrics such as CPU/RAM usage per agent, number of tasks completed per hour, recent success vs. failure ratios, and any error patterns. The audit process compares these metrics against historical baselines to identify bottlenecks or regressions. It then generates a brief report with recommendations, like “Agent XYZ is using excessive memory, consider optimization” or “Throughput has dropped 15% in the last update, investigate Agent ABC’s changes.” This helps the system “heal” over time by highlighting issues proactively so they can be addressed either automatically or by a developer.


🧠 Adaptive Intelligence Features
Adaptive Task Routing: When a new task request comes in, the orchestrator extracts key context and requirements (e.g., does it involve coding? design? data entry? internet browsing?). It then ranks the available agents by their suitability. Suitability scoring weighs factors such as an agent’s past experience with similar tasks (skill match), reliability (trust score from past successes), quality of outcomes (average QA score), and current workload (to prefer idle agents). The task is assigned to the top-scoring agent or distributed among multiple agents if it involves parallelizable subtasks. If no agent is suitable enough, the system falls back to creating a new specialized agent for the task (as described earlier). This adaptive routing means the system gets better over time at matching work to the best solver, much like a smart dispatcher.


Comprehensive Execution Reports: At the end of each mission or complex task, Mr. Fish compiles a detailed execution report. This report includes a log of actions taken by each agent, time taken for each step, any issues encountered and how they were resolved, and the final quality score of the output. If any escalations or retries occurred (e.g., a second attempt after a failure, or a human had to intervene), those are documented. The report may also include metadata such as which version of the orchestrator and agent templates were used, and any notable optimizations applied. These reports not only provide transparency (useful for auditing and trust) but also serve as documentation for the user to review what the AI did. They can be archived or shared, and they help in debugging and continuously improving agent behaviors.


📊 Monitoring & Integration
Real-Time System Health Dashboard: The platform offers real-time monitoring of agent activity and system health. The dashboard displays metrics like overall system health score (e.g., 95/100 based on recent performance and load), current CPU and memory usage by each agent, number of active agents, number of tasks completed in the last hour, etc. It can visualize trends (e.g., a graph of task throughput or success rate over time) so users can see improvements or issues after updates. This is particularly useful for power users or enterprise deployments to ensure the AI is functioning optimally and to spot any problematic agents quickly.


Enterprise Integration Ready: Thanks to a webhook-based architecture and modular design, Mr. Fish can integrate with enterprise tools and workflows. It can send outbound notifications or results to other systems – for example, creating a ticket in Jira if a task requires human review, or sending a summary report to a Slack channel when a complex job is done. The system can also receive triggers from external systems (for instance, a new entry in a database could trigger an agent to act). Security and compliance are considered in these integrations: credentials are stored securely, and interactions with enterprise data can be controlled via admin settings. These capabilities make Mr. Fish suitable for professional environments where collaboration between AI agents and human teams or other software is needed.


🔧 Technical Robustness
Robust Error Handling: Agents are designed to fail gracefully. If something goes wrong (e.g., an API call fails, a file isn’t found, or an application crashes), the agent produces a contextual error message explaining what it was trying to do. There are retry mechanisms for transient issues (like network hiccups). If a specialized agent consistently fails at a task, the orchestrator can catch that and try a different approach – for instance, hand the task over to a more general fallback agent that is programmed to troubleshoot or use an alternate method. Crucially, agents run in isolation where possible (each in their own process or container), so a crash in one won’t take down the whole system. Logging is thorough so that the exact sequence leading to an error can be traced and reproduced if needed.


Resource Optimization: The platform includes performance optimizations to run smoothly even with multiple agents. It uses caching of results where possible (so repetitive queries don’t waste time), and can swap in lighter-weight AI models if a task doesn’t require the most powerful (and resource-heavy) model. For example, an agent might use a smaller language model for simple tasks and only call on GPT-4 or similar for the most complex reasoning. Agents that go idle unload from memory to free resources. If the user’s device has a GPU, the system can leverage it for heavy tasks (or optionally offload certain computations to cloud services if enabled). Load balancing is applied when multiple agents could handle parts of a job – tasks get distributed to avoid any one agent overloading. This ensures Mr. Fish remains efficient and responsive.


💡 Unique Differentiators
Mr. Fish’s approach has several key differentiators that set it apart from simple script automation or single-agent assistants:
Truly Autonomous: The system doesn’t rely solely on pre-scripted sequences. It can encounter a novel task, devise a solution strategy, and even create new sub-agents or tools as needed to accomplish the goal – all without a human explicitly defining the steps. This goes beyond typical AI assistants by automating entire job roles, not just individual tasks.


Self-Healing (Adaptive Resilience): Mr. Fish is designed to detect when things go wrong and correct course. It has built-in self-healing: if an agent fails or produces low-quality output, the system learns and adapts, either by retraining that agent or switching strategies. This minimizes the need for constant human babysitting and makes autonomous runs more reliable over time.


Mission-Aware: The platform understands and manages high-level missions composed of many steps and agents. It’s not limited to one question = one answer. Mr. Fish can carry a project from start to finish, keeping the big picture in mind. The Vision Planner agent and multi-phase approach ensure the AI considers long-term objectives, context, and quality throughout a mission, much like a project manager coordinating a team.


Continuously Learning: With each task execution, the system gets smarter. Successful techniques are logged and reused; failed approaches lead to improvements. Agents share a knowledge base and can learn from each other’s experiences via the centralized registry and logs. Over time, this creates a compounding effect where the platform’s effectiveness grows (for example, completing tasks faster or handling more complex requests as it accumulates experience).


Enterprise-Ready: Mr. Fish is built from the ground up with enterprise use in mind. Unlike many hobby automation scripts, it includes features like role-based access control for agents, audit logs of every action, secure storage of credentials, and integration hooks for enterprise systems. This makes it viable not just for individual power users, but for teams and companies who want to deploy AI agents in production while maintaining oversight and security compliance.



🔐 Security Considerations
Given the high level of control Mr. Fish agents have on a user’s system, security is paramount. Several measures are in place (or planned) to ensure safety and prevent misuse:
Protected Credentials: All API keys and sensitive tokens required for integrations (email, cloud services, etc.) are stored in environment variables or an encrypted vault, never in code. A template .env.example is provided for users to input their keys. The repository’s .gitignore is configured to exclude any files that might contain secrets. For example, it includes entries to ignore .env files and any api_keys.py:

 plaintext
CopyEdit
*.env  
/secrets/  
api_keys.py  
 (This prevents accidental commits of credentials. Developers should never push their .env or API keys to GitHub or any public repo. Use encrypted secrets for any cloud deployment.)


Least-Privilege & Role-Based Access: Internally, agents are granted only the minimum system permissions needed for their function. For instance, an agent meant to read files won’t have the ability to delete files unless explicitly required. The backend mediates requests – if an agent tries to do something outside its allowed role, that action is blocked and logged. Future iterations will include user-defined roles or profiles that further restrict what agents can do (for example, a “No Internet” profile for an agent that should never access external resources).


Sandboxing Agents: Where possible, agents are executed in isolated environments (such as Docker containers, Linux namespace sandbox, or at least a separate user account with limited privileges on the OS). This way, even if an agent behaves unpredictably, it’s confined. For example, an agent that compiles and runs code could be run inside a container that has no access to the host OS except through controlled channels.


User Confirmation Settings: By default, Mr. Fish may start in a more conservative mode (e.g., Semi-Manual) where potentially sensitive actions (like sending an email or deleting a file) require user confirmation. Users can whitelist certain actions or folders for autonomous access once they trust the system. All potentially destructive actions are logged and can even be set to trigger a quick “are you sure?” prompt in Semi-Manual mode as a safeguard.


Automatic Memory Wipe: Agents do not keep sensitive data in memory longer than necessary. After a task completes, any confidential data (like email contents or personal info) that was loaded is cleared from the agent’s memory. Additionally, if an agent goes idle or is archived, Mr. Fish frees up its resources entirely, reducing the risk of data lingering in RAM.


Idle Timeout & Safe Shutdown: If the system is running in fully autonomous mode unattended, an inactivity timer can be set to stop agents after a certain period of no new tasks (for instance, after finishing a schedule of tasks). This prevents agents from continuing to run wild if they somehow get into a loop without user oversight. The app can also require periodic check-ins (like a human has to acknowledge it every X hours) to continue autonomous operation, in enterprise settings.


(Security will continue to be enhanced as Mr. Fish evolves, especially as we get feedback from real-world usage. The goal is to allow powerful autonomy safely, with multiple layers of protection to maintain user trust.)

Day-One Development Goals: (Initial setup tasks)
Electron App Wrapper: Initialize the Electron application that will bundle the frontend and backend. Get a basic “Hello World” app running to verify the environment on Windows/macOS.


Backend Server Setup: Implement a simple API server (FastAPI for Python or an Express server for Node) with endpoints to accept a task request and return status/results. This includes a stub orchestrator that for now might just call a single dummy agent. Set up a basic agent class and a manager to load/register agents.


Frontend App Setup: Create a basic React (or Svelte) application that can send a task prompt to the backend and display the response. Include UI components for switching modes and a button for voice input (initially non-functional or using a dummy handler). Ensure the frontend can communicate with the backend (e.g., via HTTP or an IPC if using Electron’s messaging).


Dockerization: Write a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to containerize the backend (and possibly the frontend) for easier environment setup. Confirm the app can run in Docker similarly to running directly, to aid consistent development and future deployment.


Database Integration: Set up a local SQLite database and an ORM or query layer. Implement a simple schema for an Agent Registry (table with agent info and stats) and a Task Log. Verify that the backend can read/write to the DB (for example, adding a new agent entry or logging a received task). This will lay the groundwork for persistent agent data and workflow history.


Feature Implementation Plan (MVP):
Agent Creation & Training: Develop functionality for both manual agent creation (user provides a prompt or settings to create a new agent persona) and automatic creation via the scoring logic. The scoring engine will compare required skills (extracted from the task description) with each agent’s profile. If no agent has >70% match, spawn a new agent. For MVP, the “training” of a new agent can be as simple as initializing some prompt context or fine-tuning a small model on a few example data points related to the task (this could be just simulated or simplified to start). Ensure the new agent is saved in the registry with meta info like creation date, parent task, etc.


Lyra Optimizer Engine: Implement the Lyra dual-prompt optimization as a module. When a user enters a request, before any agent sees it, pass it to the Lyra module which performs: (1) deconstruction and clarity improvement of the prompt, (2) a second refinement focusing on structure and detail. This could involve rules or even another AI model specialized for prompt optimization. For MVP, even a template-based transformation or a set of heuristics (like ensuring the prompt has a clear objective, context, and output format) can be used. The output is a polished prompt that then goes into agent orchestration.


Execution Router (Orchestrator): Develop the orchestration logic that takes an optimized prompt and decides how to execute it. Initially, this can be simplified: if the task can be done by one agent, just call that agent’s execute function. If the task is recognized as a “mission” (maybe by containing keywords or by length/complexity), invoke a simplified Vision Planner that splits it into two or three subtasks (e.g., “plan -> do -> verify”). For MVP, hardcode or use simple rules for a couple of cases. Over time this will evolve into the full dynamic planner. The orchestrator should handle receiving results from agents and either passing the next task or finishing up and returning the final result to the frontend.


QA & Feedback Loop: After an agent (or sequence of agents) produces a result, implement a basic QA check. For example, if the expected output is a file, check if the file exists and maybe size or simple correctness criteria. Or if it’s text, possibly use a secondary model to review it. Assign a score. If the score is below threshold, log that outcome and, for MVP, simply flag it in the UI and suggest the user to retry or switch to semi-manual mode. More advanced automatic retraining might be stubbed or scheduled for later unless it’s straightforward (e.g., re-run the agent with a more detailed prompt).


Voice Mode: Integrate a speech-to-text system. The simplest approach is to use an API like OpenAI’s Whisper API for accurate transcription of short voice commands. Alternatively, an offline library like Vosk can be packaged to avoid external calls. Implement the voice toggle button in the UI so that when activated, it starts recording audio, then sends it to the speech-to-text module, and the resulting text is treated as a user prompt (or command). For MVP, handle basic commands – it can essentially treat any transcribed speech as if the user typed it. (Future improvements will include hotwords or special voice commands for things like “pause”, “stop”, etc.)


Dashboard UI Enhancements: Expand the frontend to show a live “task execution view.” This could be as simple as a list of steps that appear as the agent works (e.g., “✔️ Opened Gmail... ✔️ Found latest email... ⏳ Launching Blender...” with icons to indicate progress). Also show the current mode and allow mode switching (a dropdown or toggle). If voice is active, indicate that (maybe change the mic icon color). Ensure the UI remains responsive and can handle updates coming from the backend (you might use WebSockets or periodically poll for status during a run). Logging: include a panel or area where detailed logs or errors are printed for advanced users to inspect.


Agent App Store (v1): Set up the framework for an internal agent marketplace. For MVP, this could simply read from a local store/manifest.json which lists some example agents/workflows (the ones we include). Provide a UI list in the app where users can click to load one of these example agents or workflows into their registry. It might show the name, description, and a “use this agent” button. Actual uploading/downloading from an online repository can be planned for later; initially, focus on the interface and the ability to import a packaged agent file (could be a JSON or Python file describing the agent).


Prebuilt Agent Templates (included in MVP)
To demonstrate and test the platform, several example agents and workflows are bundled with the MVP. These serve as both useful out-of-the-box functionalities and reference implementations for developers:
🏠 Interior Design Agent: Automates interior design drafts. For example, it can take input from a client email (room dimensions, style preferences), then open a 3D modeling tool (Blender or use an API like RoomGPT) to create a room layout. It sources furniture ideas from online catalogs (e.g., scraping IKEA for items within budget) and produces a final design board or 3D render. (Template highlights: using an email integration, launching a desktop app, performing image generation.)


🎬 Video Editing Agent: Takes raw video and produces an edited clip. It could control a video editing application via keyboard shortcuts or scripting (e.g., Adobe Premiere with a Python API or FFmpeg for simpler edits). The agent cuts out silences or bad takes, adds a title and background music, and exports the final video. (Template highlights: file manipulation, possibly controlling a GUI or using command-line tools, working with multimedia content.)


📱 App Development Agent: Given a description of an app (like “To-do list app with user login and item due dates”), this agent will scaffold a basic application. It might use a combination of code generation (with an LLM writing code), using frameworks (create-react-app / Next.js for frontend, a simple Node or Flask server for backend), setting up a SQLite or simple database, and then integrating them. It could even launch the app locally or deploy to a free hosting tier for demonstration. (Template highlights: code generation, using multiple agents for frontend vs backend, deployment steps.)


🧵 Clothing Design Agent: Automates parts of fashion design. It could take a sketch or description of a garment and produce a digital pattern or a 3D model. Perhaps it integrates with a tool like CLO3D or uses image-to-design AI to propose variations. It then finds a manufacturer or outputs a spec sheet. (Template highlights: creative design AI integration, file output.)


🌐 Website Launch Agent: Takes a prompt for a marketing website or blog and creates it live. For instance, “Create a one-page website for a bakery called SweetBites that has a menu section, about, and contact form.” The agent would generate the HTML/CSS (maybe use a template generator), fill in placeholder content, and deploy it (possibly via GitHub Pages or a headless CMS). (Template highlights: end-to-end web project automation.)


📈 Marketing Automation Agent: Acts on a schedule or loop: it might take an input like “Promote our new feature on social media this week.” It then drafts posts for Twitter, LinkedIn, maybe creates a simple graphic via an API (Canva or DALL-E), posts them via API at optimal times, monitors engagement metrics (likes, shares), and compiles a report or adjusts the content strategy (like trying different hashtags or posting times next week). (Template highlights: scheduled tasks, external API use for social platforms, simple analytics.)


Each example comes with a template script and configuration in the examples/ folder. Users can load these to see how Mr. Fish orchestrates multiple steps. They also serve as starting points to create new agents (e.g., one can take the App Development Agent and extend it to a specific framework or stack).
Post-MVP Development Roadmap
After the MVP is validated, the following features and improvements are planned to further enhance Mr. Fish:
Visual Workflow Builder: A drag-and-drop interface for creating and editing agent workflows. This would let users graphically design the sequence of tasks or decision logic, making it easier to customize or debug workflows without digging into code. (Imagine a flowchart-style editor where each node is an agent action or a conditional branch.)


Cross-Agent Memory Sync: Implement a shared memory knowledge base that all agents can read/write. This could be a vector database or common context store so that, for example, a research agent can drop findings in memory and a writing agent can pick them up. This enables collaboration and avoids duplication of effort when agents work as a team.


Multi-User & Cloud Collaboration: Expand Mr. Fish to support multiple users or a cloud backend. This might involve a cloud service where agents can run on a server and multiple team members can trigger or monitor tasks (with proper access control). It also includes version control for agents and workflows, so teams can share their custom agents securely within an organization.


Browser and Email Plugins: Provide browser extensions (Chrome/Firefox) and email client plugins (Gmail/Outlook) to seamlessly feed data to Mr. Fish. For instance, a Chrome extension could allow an agent to scrape or summarize the currently open webpage, or an email plugin could let an agent analyze an email thread at a click. These would function through secure channels to the Mr. Fish app, giving agents supervised access to web and email content when authorized by the user.


Global Agent Marketplace: Evolve the internal store into a full online marketplace where users can publish their agents and workflows for others to download. Include ratings, reviews, categories (e.g., “Finance”, “Design”, “Productivity”), and search functionality. This would require a cloud backend to host the shared agents and possibly a review process to ensure quality and security of submissions.


Enhanced Voice Interaction: Make the voice mode more conversational and robust. The goal is to allow a user to have a back-and-forth dialog entirely via voice, with the agent clarifying requirements or reporting progress verbally. This would involve text-to-speech output, better NLP for understanding casual spoken instructions, and maybe wake-word detection to go truly hands-free. Also, integrate with smart speakers or phones for remote voice commanding.


Fine-Grained Access Control: Develop an admin console (especially for enterprise use) where one can set permissions for each agent or workflow – for example, which directories they can access, which applications they can control, network access yes/no, etc. Include an auditing interface to review everything agents have done, with the ability to revoke or undo unauthorized actions if ever needed.


Performance Scaling: Optimize and possibly distribute the architecture for heavy workloads. This might include enabling GPU acceleration for AI model inference, allowing some agents to run on separate processes or machines (distributed agents), and improving concurrency (so multiple tasks can be processed in parallel by different agents). As tasks get more complex, this ensures the system remains responsive and tasks complete in reasonable time.



🔟 Advanced Use Case Scenarios (Across Verticals)
Beyond the MVP, imagine fully realized autonomous agents tackling ambitious scenarios in various industries. These examples illustrate Mr. Fish’s long-term potential to transform work:
🧠 Software Development & SaaS Operations: Use Case: A product manager files a feature request. The agent reads the spec from Jira, plans the implementation, creates a new Git branch, writes code for the feature (front-end and back-end), runs tests, and merges the code. It then deploys the update to staging, verifies it, and pushes to production. Documentation is updated and release notes are drafted automatically.


✅ Syncs with version control (GitHub) for branching and PRs, documentation platforms (e.g. Confluence or Notion for updating docs), and testing frameworks (running unit/integration tests).


✅ Monitors error tracking and user feedback after deployment. If bugs are reported, it opens tickets or even attempts to fix them, retraining itself on the failure cases. This essentially automates a full devOps cycle for minor features or patches.


🏠 Interior Design & 3D Rendering: Use Case: A client emails room details and style preferences. The agent retrieves the email specifics, then launches a 3D modeling tool to create a detailed interior design mockup. It populates the room with furniture that matches the style and budget, using online catalogs to pick real items. The agent then generates a PDF design proposal with room layouts, item lists, and pricing.


✅ Incorporates QA feedback by checking that chosen furniture fits the dimensions and budget constraints, and that the overall design meets the style described (using an aesthetic evaluation model). If something is off, it iterates (e.g., replacing an out-of-stock item, adjusting layout for better flow).


✅ Provides real-time previews or options to the client (via email or a web portal). For example, it might send two design variations and ask the client for feedback, then adapt the final design based on the response, ensuring client satisfaction before finalizing.


💼 B2B Sales Prospecting Engine: Use Case: A startup founder wants more customers. The agent analyzes the startup’s product and ideal customer profile (ICP) from a description or PDF pitch deck. It then uses tools to find potential leads (e.g., searches LinkedIn or a sales database for relevant titles and industries). For each prospect, it drafts a personalized outreach email highlighting how the product solves their specific pain point. It sends these emails, monitors replies, and if a reply is positive, it can even respond to schedule a call.


✅ Uses large language models to tailor each email using the prospect’s background (e.g., referencing their company or role).


✅ Automates follow-ups: if no response in a week, it sends a polite nudge. When someone expresses interest, the agent can book a meeting by integrating with a calendar scheduling app (like Calendly) and place a meeting on the founder’s calendar. This agent essentially operates as a Sales Development Rep (SDR).


🎬 AI Movie Generator: Use Case: A filmmaker provides a script idea or rough storyboard. The agent writes a full screenplay, then uses generative AI tools to create visual scenes. For example, it generates concept art or storyboards with an image AI (like Midjourney), and perhaps even uses video generation models (like Runway ML) to create short clips. It assembles these into a rough film, with AI voices for characters and AI-composed background music. The result is a draft movie that the filmmaker can review.


✅ Handles the entire production pipeline virtually: script writing, scene planning, visual generation, editing, and sound design.


✅ Can iterate based on feedback – for instance, if the filmmaker says “make it more suspenseful”, the agent might adjust the lighting and music of key scenes automatically and regenerate sections. This drastically reduces the cost and time for prototyping a film.


🛒 E-commerce Business Launch: Use Case: An entrepreneur describes a product idea (say, a custom smart home gadget). The agent conducts market research – it gathers data from forums, keyword searches, and existing product reviews to assess demand and find differentiation points. Then it finds suppliers or manufacturers (searches Alibaba or local manufacturers) and even initiates contact to get quotes. Simultaneously, it builds an online store: writes copy highlighting the product’s benefits, creates some promotional images (maybe via AI if product is not manufactured yet), sets up a Shopify site or similar, and integrates a payment system. It also creates initial marketing campaigns (Google Ads/Facebook Ads) targeting likely customers.


✅ Iteratively optimizes the storefront using analytics – for example, after a week, it analyzes site traffic and if many people drop off at the homepage, it will adjust the page design or copy.


✅ Manages ad budget and ROI: it can pause underperforming ads or allocate more budget to channels that show better conversion. Essentially acts as a one-person startup launch team covering research, supply chain, web development, and marketing.


📚 Online Course Creator: Use Case: A teacher provides raw materials (text notes, a syllabus, or recorded lectures). The agent turns this into a polished online course. It structures the content into modules, writes out explanations and summaries for each lesson, generates slides for key points, and even creates quizzes and answer keys. For multimedia, it might produce voice-over lectures using text-to-speech or avatar video generation (for example, creating a virtual instructor video). The agent then uploads all this to a learning platform (like Coursera, Udemy, or a custom site) and creates a landing page for the course.


✅ Utilizes AI transcription (if starting from recorded lectures) and then text generation to fill gaps and ensure the material flows well.


✅ Adds engaging elements: can include illustrative diagrams (via drawing tools or stock image APIs), does formatting, and ensures accessibility (adding subtitles to videos, etc.). It can even set up an email drip campaign to market the course to subscribers.


🧑‍⚕️ Personal Health & Wellness Coach: Use Case: A user grants the agent access to their fitness tracker data, diet app, and calendar. The agent analyzes the user’s exercise habits, sleep patterns, and nutrition. It then creates a personalized 12-week health plan: scheduling workouts (tailored to the user’s preferences and schedule), planning meals with recipes to meet nutritional goals, and setting weekly targets. Each day, it can send a morning briefing (“Today’s workout: 30 minutes of cardio. Don’t forget to hydrate. Here’s a healthy recipe for dinner…”). It adjusts the plan based on progress – if the user is consistently missing morning workouts, it reschedules them to evenings, for example.


✅ Continuously monitors data: if the user’s wearable reports poor sleep for a few days, the agent might alter the plan to reduce intensity or add a recovery day, and offer tips for better sleep.


✅ Flags anomalies: if it detects something potentially serious (e.g., heart rate trends that are concerning or signs of overtraining), it alerts the user or recommends seeing a doctor. Essentially acts as a personal trainer + nutritionist + life coach in one, with constant adaptation.


🕹️ Game Development Assistant: Use Case: A game designer dreams up a new game concept. The agent takes the high-level idea and produces a playable prototype. It can generate code for gameplay mechanics (leveraging game engine APIs like Unity or Unreal via their scripting languages), create or source placeholder art assets, design a few levels or scenarios, and implement basic gameplay loops. The agent might use AI to generate textures or 3D models for the environment, create sound effects or background music, and put it all together. It then launches the game for the designer to try.


✅ Sets up a version control repository for the game, so the human designer can also tweak or add to it. The agent can integrate those changes later.


✅ Uses player feedback simulation: it might simulate some automated gameplay to see if certain levels are too hard or too easy (balancing), and adjust parameters accordingly. Over time, this could evolve into a full AI-powered game studio assistant that takes a concept to beta release with minimal human coding.


🧾 Legal & Compliance Assistant: Use Case: A small business needs various legal documents and to ensure they comply with regulations. The agent asks a few questions to understand the context (type of business, jurisdiction, etc.), then prepares needed documents: incorporation papers, employee contracts, NDAs, privacy policies – using templates and legal AI models. It files the necessary forms with government websites (for business registration, for example), fills out tax forms or compliance reports, and diarizes important deadlines (annual filings, license renewals). It keeps an eye on relevant law changes (like new data protection regulations) and alerts the business if they need to update something.


✅ Checks all generated documents against a database of regulations to ensure they’re up-to-date and valid in the specific jurisdiction (for instance, making sure a contract includes clauses mandated by local law).


✅ Monitors for updates: for example, if a new labor law is passed that affects the business, the agent will highlight this and either update the employee handbook or suggest actions to comply. In effect, this agent takes on the role of a legal assistant or compliance officer that tirelessly keeps the business on the right side of the law.


🏢 Business Operations (BizOps) Copilot: Use Case: The CEO of a company can speak to the agent as if it’s a BizOps consultant. They might ask, “Help me identify where we can cut costs by 10% without layoffs.” The agent will dig into the company’s data (financial spreadsheets, sales figures, operational metrics), identify inefficiencies or high expense areas, and produce a report with suggestions (e.g., “Software spend is high – 20% above industry benchmark, consider consolidating tools or renegotiating licenses; Outsourcing X could save Y%; Inventory turnover is slow on product Z – maybe discontinue or market it more.”). It can also simulate the impact of changes (like projecting the financial outcome if a suggestion is implemented).


✅ Produces visuals and dashboards: automatically generate updated charts of key metrics and even real-time dashboards that management can look at.


✅ Can take actions: for example, if one suggestion is to reduce cost on cloud servers, the agent might automatically adjust the server plans or turn off unused instances (with approval). If a strategy change is suggested, it could draft an internal memo or slides for the CEO to review. Essentially, it augments the executive’s decision-making with data-driven insights and executes operational tweaks within set guardrails.


(These scenarios demonstrate long-term vision. Not all are fully achievable with current tech or without custom integration, but they guide the development of Mr. Fish to eventually handle such complex tasks. Many of these involve replacing or augmenting roles that are currently high-salary positions – showcasing the disruptive potential of the platform.)

🧠 Pretrained Advisory Agents Panel (Advisory Agent Store)
As an advanced feature, Mr. Fish includes an Advisory Agents Panel, which is like having a council of expert advisors (simulated via AI) to guide and enhance your projects. These advisors don’t execute tasks directly; instead, they offer insights, critiques, and suggestions to improve the outcomes of your primary agents. You can think of it as an integrated “brain trust” of specialized AI consultants (inspired by visionary thinkers, domain experts, and designers) that can be summoned on demand.
How it works: Users can select from a catalog of pre-trained advisor personas grouped by domain. Once activated, these advisor agents passively observe the task inputs and plans, and inject recommendations or prompt tweaks. They can operate in a passive mode (influencing the main agents behind the scenes) or in a prompt augmentation mode (where their suggestions are explicitly merged into the task prompt or shown to the user for confirmation).
🎓 Advisory Panel Overview
Feature
Description
Max Advisors (Free)
5 at once (users on the free tier can enable up to five advisors simultaneously)
Max Advisors (Pro/Paid)
Unlimited selection (Pro users can utilize the full panel of advisors as needed)
Usage Mode
Can run in passive background mode (advisors influence the primary agent’s decisions quietly) or in an active mode where they provide prompt suggestions and reasoning that the user can review.
Advisor Functions
Idea brainstorming, prompt refinement, UX/design feedback, innovation prompts, research insights, educational guidance, and user-experience tuning. Advisors collectively cover a wide range of perspectives to ensure well-rounded decision making.

Featured Advisory Clusters: (organized by domain and expertise – users can pick advisors individually or by cluster)
🏛️ Visionary Thinkers Panel – Focus: Strategic foresight, minimalist design, education, and human-centric thinking. Includes advisors modeled after:


Steve Jobs – Intuitive user experience, focus on simplicity and narrative in products.


Sal Khan – Clarity in instruction and scalability in education (ensuring solutions can teach or explain themselves well).


Temple Grandin – Emphasis on neurodiverse thinking and humane, practical design (particularly relevant for workflow processes or user environments).


Maria Montessori – Advocate of user-driven (or student-driven) exploration and learning, useful for crafting autonomy that still feels guided by the user’s interest.


Yuval Noah Harari – Big-picture humanistic and long-term implications (ensuring that strategies consider future and societal impact).

Laszlo Polgar – Expertise in talent development and training (could guide how agents self-train or how to structure learning tasks).


🏗️ Master Builders & Spatial Designers – Focus: Architecture of systems (both literal and metaphorical), spatial design, sustainable structures. These advisors inspire creating systems or environments (including UI/UX or even virtual spaces) that are both functional and inspiring:


Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Renzo Piano, Toyo Ito, Norman Foster – Innovators in architecture and spatial design, encouraging creative structure, flowing design, and sometimes breaking conventional rules to create new experiences. Useful to inspire UI layouts or multi-agent system structures that are non-linear and creative.


Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe – Principles of form-follows-function, seamless integration with environment, and functional minimalism in design. These push agents to eliminate waste and ensure every element serves a purpose.


Marina Tabassum, Richard Rogers, Glenn Murcutt – Focus on sustainability, inclusivity, and responsive design. They might advise on making solutions more resource-efficient or accessible.


Antoni Gaudí, Santiago Calatrava – Emphasis on organic, awe-inspiring design and engineering that still serves practical goals. They nudge creativity and ambition in projects (useful when an output should be visually or structurally impressive).


👩‍🎨 UX & Interaction Design Advisors – Focus: User interface and experience excellence. These advisors ensure the outputs (be it a designed product, an app, or content) are user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing:


Dieter Rams – “Less is more” philosophy, ten principles of good design (useful for pruning unnecessary complexity in any solution).


Jonathan Ive – Emotional resonance in design combined with function (advises on making outcomes delightful, not just functional).


John Maeda – Intersection of technology, art, and design simplicity, especially with computational design – pushes for creative computation solutions.


Paola Antonelli – Design as a reflection of culture and society (ensuring outputs connect with human values and cultural context).


🎓 Education & Learning Experts – Focus: Effective teaching, knowledge transfer, and learning design (useful when outputs involve training users or explaining concepts):


Esther Duflo – Data-driven social outcomes (reminding the agent to consider evidence-based results, particularly in educational content).


Sugata Mitra – Minimally invasive education (encourages solutions that let users discover and learn naturally).


Sir Ken Robinson – Creativity in education and unlocking human potential (advising to incorporate creativity and personalization).


Esther Wojcicki – Practical, experience-based learning strategies (focusing on real-world relevance and empowerment).


Daphne Koller – Online education and interactive learning (ensuring any educational aspect of outputs is interactive and engaging).


Nicholas Negroponte – Tech for education, futurism in learning (pushing use of cutting-edge tech in educational solutions).


🧠 Psychology & Motivation Architects – Focus: User motivation, cognitive load, mental health aspects. Advisors here help make sure solutions consider the end-user’s psychological state and encourage positive engagement:


Carol Dweck – Growth mindset (making outputs that encourage learning from mistakes, iteration).


Daniel Kahneman – Cognitive biases and decision making (agents should account for biases in data or user decisions and strive for clarity).


Angela Duckworth – Grit and persistence (promote features that encourage continued effort and reward persistence, possibly in habit-building scenarios).


Brené Brown – Emotional intelligence and trust (ensuring the AI’s communications build trust and handle vulnerabilities with care).


Gabor Maté, Bessel van der Kolk – Trauma-informed and compassionate approach (useful for any wellness or support-related tasks to ensure kindness and understanding in the agent’s outputs).

Demis Hassabis – (DeepMind) pushing boundaries of AI, encourages ambitious technical solutions and use of advanced ML techniques.


Fei-Fei Li – Human-centered AI and strong vision intelligence (advises on using AI in ways that augment human capability and include visual understanding).


Andrej Karpathy – Deep learning and coding expertise (could guide coding agents to best practices in AI coding, or suggest when to use neural nets vs. simpler methods).


Ian Goodfellow – Creativity (inventor of GANs – could inspire agents to generate creative content or consider adversarial perspectives for robust solutions).


Jennifer Doudna – Biotech and rigorous science approach (emphasizes experimental validation and precision, metaphorically useful even outside biology, to remind the system to test and verify results).


Stephen Hawking – Big-picture scientific reasoning (ensure agents consider fundamental principles and long-term ramifications, not just quick wins).


🌍 Ethics, Society & Governance – Focus: Ethical AI, societal impact, governance of technology:


Shoshana Zuboff – Privacy and surveillance concerns (advises on data privacy, ensuring the agent respects user data and doesn’t overreach).


Martha Nussbaum – Human rights and ethics in outcomes (ensures solutions respect dignity, equality, and are fair).


Audrey Tang – Open governance and civic tech (encourages transparency, citizen involvement where relevant, and open data principles).


Ruha Benjamin – Ethical considerations regarding race/gender/social biases (reminds the system to check for biases in data or approach and correct them).


Joy Buolamwini – Fairness in AI (specifically in facial recognition and beyond – pushes agents to be fair and accountable, to avoid algorithmic bias).


Related features and usage modes:
🎙️ Voice Advisors (Future): The platform is planning to give voices to these advisors, so in the future you could literally hear a quick comment from “Steve” or “Dieter” in their style as the agent is working. For now, they contribute via text.


🔁 Auto-Swap Suggestions: The system can recommend which advisors might be most useful for a given project. As your project evolves (say you move from planning to execution), it might suggest swapping in a different set of advisors better suited to the new phase.


🧠 Synthetic Debate Mode: You can optionally enable a mode where advisors debate or present diverse viewpoints on a decision. It’s like having a mini panel discussion – useful for strategy brainstorming where you want the AI to consider multiple angles (for example, one advisor argues for a bold approach, another urges caution, and the system then finds a balanced solution).


Using the Advisory Panel in Mr. Fish:
Navigate to the “Advisory Panel” tab in the Mr. Fish UI (available in advanced settings).


Select up to 5 advisors (on the free tier) or more if you have Pro. You can either choose individual personas or pick a pre-made cluster (like “Visionary Panel” which auto-selects a set of advisors).


During any task execution, decide how you want the advisors to participate:


Passive Mode: Advisors watch the process and subtly influence the primary agent’s prompts and decisions. You won’t see much UI output from them, but know that behind the scenes, Steve Jobs might be nudging the UX to be simpler, Kahneman might be warning about a potential cognitive bias, etc.


Prompt Augmentation Mode: Advisors actively generate suggestions. For example, when you input a prompt or when the system formulates a plan, you’ll see comments like “💡 Jobs suggests: focus on a simpler user flow here” or “⚖️ Zuboff cautions: consider user privacy when collecting data.” You can review these suggestions and decide to apply or ignore them. The Lyra optimizer can also incorporate their feedback automatically into the refined prompt.


You can filter advisors by domain or search for a name or keyword (e.g., “education” to find education-related advisors). Each advisor has a brief description of their style which you can view before adding.


Once advisors are active, you’ll notice real-time guidance in the Task Visualizer log, for example:


“💡 Jobs recommends removing unnecessary steps to reduce friction.”


“🎯 Montessori: Maybe allow the user more freedom at this step (consider a more exploratory flow).”


“⚖️ Zuboff: Are we respecting user consent with this data usage?”
 These appear as italicized tips associated with the relevant step or decision.


You can save groups of advisors as presets for different scenarios. For instance, a preset for “Educational Game Project” might include Maria Montessori, Sir Ken Robinson, John Maeda, and Carol Dweck – combining education, design, and motivation angles.


Governance & Explainability:
All advisor contributions are logged for transparency. You can review which advisor’s idea influenced a decision in the execution report. This is important for trust and auditing; you’ll know if a particular suggestion led the agent astray or helped, and you can adjust the advisor mix accordingly.


Advisors do not have direct control over executing tasks – they only suggest and influence. This separation ensures that enabling an advisor won’t cause unexpected actions, it only refines what the primary agents do.


You remain the final decision maker. The advisors form a council of perspectives, but Mr. Fish will not act on controversial suggestions without your go-ahead if you’re in Semi or Manual modes. In Autonomous mode, their suggestions are merged automatically for efficiency, but the assumption is you have vetted the advisors you trust in that scenario.


Reminder: You are the orchestrator of this AI ensemble. The Advisory Panel is there to inspire and guide the AI’s approach with world-class expertise simulations, but you choose whose advice to follow and how to apply it. This feature aims to ensure that even as AI agents work autonomously, they do so with a depth of wisdom and diversity of thought that leads to better outcomes.

🛠 Developer Setup & Usage (README Guide)
This section serves as a guide for developers or advanced users setting up Mr. Fish, as well as a basic user guide for running tasks.
Installation & Environment
Clone the Repository:

 bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mrfish.git  
cd mrfish  


Install Dependencies: Depending on the tech stack chosen for the backend, install the required packages:


If using Node.js/Express backend: npm install (in the project root, to install both front-end and back-end packages if using a monorepo structure).


If using Python/FastAPI backend: create a virtual environment and pip install -r requirements.txt for backend dependencies, and run npm install for the front-end part.


Set Up Environment Variables: Copy .env.example to .env and fill in any necessary configuration. This includes API keys for any external services (OpenAI API for certain language capabilities, etc.), and settings like default mode or integration toggles. Do not commit this .env file. Ensure it’s listed in .gitignore.


Build/Run the Application: You have multiple options:


Direct (Development Mode):


Start the backend server:
 For Node/Express, npm run backend (or node backend/app.js).
 For Python/FastAPI, uvicorn backend.app:app --reload.


Start the front-end development server:
 npm run dev (which will launch the React/Vite dev server on a port, e.g., http://localhost:3000).


Launch Electron (for desktop wrapper):
 npm run electron (this will open the Electron app window that loads the front-end and connects to the local backend).
 In dev mode, you can also just use the web UI in a browser pointed to the dev server, but Electron is needed for full functionality (to allow OS-level interactions).


Using Docker:
 If you prefer containerization or are on an environment where setting up node/python is difficult, use Docker:

 bash
CopyEdit
docker build -t mrfish .  
docker-compose up  
 This will build and run the container(s). The Docker setup runs the backend and frontend together. You might still need to connect to the container’s display for the GUI (for Linux, ensure X11 forwarding or VNC if headless). On Windows/Mac, Electron can run natively outside the container connecting to the backend in the container if configured.


Initial Configuration: The first time you run Mr. Fish, it may prompt you to grant certain OS permissions, especially for automation (e.g., on macOS, allowing control of accessibility features for GUI automation). Follow the on-screen instructions to enable these, as they are required for agents to control applications. The app will also generate an initial set of example agents in your local database (if not already present).


Basic Usage Workflow
Once the app is running and the UI is open, here’s how you can use Mr. Fish to execute a task:
Launch the app & Login (if applicable): Open the Mr. Fish desktop app. If a login or API key is required (for Pro features or cloud sync), you’ll be prompted; otherwise, you land on the dashboard.


(Optional) Enable Voice Mode: If you want to use voice input, click the 🎤 microphone toggle button. You can configure it to be push-to-talk (default: hold the button while speaking) or tap-to-toggle (click once to start listening continuously, click again to stop). Ensure your microphone is working; the app will indicate when it’s listening.


Enter a Task Prompt: In the prompt input box at the top of the dashboard, type what you want the agent(s) to do, or if using voice, speak your request clearly. For example: “Organize my latest downloads into folders by file type and send me an email summary.” Hit Enter (or say a trigger phrase like “Go ahead” if in voice mode) to submit the task.


Prompt Optimization (Lyra in action): Immediately, you might notice in the log or UI that the system is refining your prompt. The Lyra module runs two passes to clarify and optimize your request. You might briefly see a message like “Optimizing prompt for clarity…” This happens quickly; after optimization, the system now has a well-defined game plan for the agents. (In advanced view, you could see the before-and-after of the prompt to understand the improvements.)


Choose Execution Mode: If you haven’t set a default or if the system isn’t sure, it may ask which mode to run in (Autonomous, Semi-Manual, Manual Assist). For instance, if the task could be risky or system-altering (like file operations), it might default to Semi-Manual and ask for confirmation. Select the mode you want. (You can also set a persistent default in settings, and skip this step for future tasks.)


Agent/Mission Execution: Now Mr. Fish goes to work. Depending on the task, it will either assign it to a single agent or break it into subtasks and spin up multiple agents. You will see live updates in the dashboard as things happen. For example:


“Agent A (FileOrganizer) launching Finder…”


“Agent A is scanning ~/Downloads (20 files found)”


“Agent B (Emailer) composing summary email”
 If in Semi-Manual mode, the agent might pause and ask: “Found 5 image files, 3 documents. Do you want them sorted into Images/Docs folders? (Y/N)” – you can respond in the interface or via voice.
 The UI will highlight each step as completed (✔️) or in progress (⏳). You can click on an agent’s name to see more details about what it’s doing, and you can always press a “Pause” or “Abort” button to stop the process if something looks wrong.


Result Delivery: When the workflow is complete, you will be notified. The results depend on the task – it could be a file created, an application opened with output, an email sent, etc. Mr. Fish will present a summary: e.g., “Task Complete: 20 files organized into 4 folders. Email sent to [you@example.com]. QA Score: 95.” If in Manual mode, you’ll instead get the instructions or script to do it yourself (e.g., a list of recommended steps or a generated script you can run).


The platform also logs a QA score or success metric. In Autonomous mode, if this score was below the acceptable threshold, the system might have already attempted a correction (you’ll see log entries for that). If it’s still low, the summary might say something like “Task completed with warnings; review recommended.” In Semi-Manual, you likely caught issues during the run.


Review and Save (if desired): You can expand the detailed report to see everything the agent did. If this is a workflow you might want to repeat, you can click “Save Workflow” to turn it into a reusable template. You’ll be prompted to name it, and then it appears in your Templates list for future one-click execution. If something didn’t go as expected, you can adjust settings or give feedback. For instance, you could increase an agent’s “cautiousness” setting if it was too aggressive, or provide an example of desired output to help it learn. Over time, these tweaks make the agents more effective for your specific needs.


Pausing/Interrupting: At any point, you can press the Pause button to temporarily halt the agents. In pause mode, you can intervene – e.g., do a step manually, or modify the plan. Then you can resume. The Stop button will cancel the task entirely; agents will attempt to gracefully finish what they’re doing and not start new actions. This is useful if you spot the agent going down an unintended path (though thanks to safeguards and the Lyra optimizer, that should be rare for well-specified tasks).
Troubleshooting & Logging
If the system isn’t behaving as expected, here are some tips:
View Logs: The UI has a Logs panel where you can see detailed debug messages. Additionally, textual log files are stored in the logs/ directory on your machine (rotating daily). These logs include timestamps, agent IDs, actions, and any error messages or stack traces if exceptions occurred. Examining logs can reveal issues like missing file permissions or integration failures.


Common Issues: In early versions, common hiccups might include:


Missing permissions (e.g., on macOS, not granting the app control accessibility will prevent GUI automation. Solution: enable it in System Preferences > Security & Privacy).


Missing API keys (if you asked an agent to use an external service, ensure the key is provided in the .env and the service is accessible).


Application paths not found (if an agent tries to open an app by name and it’s not installed or named differently). You can configure aliases for app names in the settings or ensure the agent knows where to look.


Stuck Agents: If an agent seems stuck (no progress for a while), the system should detect and handle it (Crisis Detection). But you can manually stop and check. Often it might be waiting on an external process. The log might show what it’s waiting for. If needed, you can kill the agent process via the OS task manager (each agent runs in a separate process with a recognizable name). The orchestrator will catch that the agent died and attempt recovery or at least log an error.


Updates & Patches: Because Mr. Fish is evolving, ensure you have the latest version if you encounter a bug. Check the project repository for any patches addressing your issue. If not, you might be encountering a new bug – consider reaching out on our support channels or filing an issue with as much detail as possible.


Updating or Extending Agents
Developers can modify and create new agents by adding code to the backend/agents/ directory (or equivalent, depending on how agents are implemented). Each agent might consist of a class or function defining its behavior, some configuration (like what tools or permissions it has), and optionally some training data or prompts.
Hot-reloading: In development, it’s useful to have the backend reload if you change an agent’s code. If using FastAPI/Node with watch mode, this can be automatic. If not, you’ll need to restart the backend to see changes. The front-end will reconnect automatically.


Agent Definition: Look at the existing examples for guidance. For instance, an agent might have a structure like: class FileOrganizerAgent(BaseAgent): ... with a method run(task) that the orchestrator calls.


Testing Agents: You can test an agent in isolation by calling it directly (some agents have standalone test scripts in the examples/ folder). Or use the Manual Assist mode to have the agent print out what it would do without actually doing it. This is a good way to verify logic without side effects.


Sharing Agents: If you create a useful agent, you can add it to your local marketplace manifest to use it via the UI. In the future, you’ll be able to share it through the global marketplace for others to download.


Contributing to Mr. Fish
Contributions are welcome to help make Mr. Fish more powerful and reliable! Here are ways you can contribute:
🧩 New Agent Templates: Have an idea for a useful agent or workflow? You can create a new example in the examples/ directory with a clear README and script. For instance, a “Stock Trading Agent” or “Medical Data Analyzer” – anything that could showcase new domains. Submit it as a pull request for inclusion.


🐛 Bug Fixes: If you find a bug and have a fix, please submit a PR. Check the Issues tab on GitHub to see if it’s known. Including a clear description of the bug and how your fix addresses it will speed up review.


⚙️ Core Improvements: The core orchestrator, Lyra optimizer, and other infrastructure can always be improved. Maybe you can enhance the scoring algorithm for agent selection, or implement a better planning strategy, or integrate a new ML model (like using a larger context window model for the Vision Planner). These larger contributions are welcome – it’s best to open an Issue or Discussion first to make sure it aligns with the roadmap.


🌐 Integrations: Write integration modules for new apps or services. For example, if you want Mr. Fish to work with a specific design tool or enterprise system, you can add a connector and an example agent using it.


📝 Documentation & Testing: We appreciate improvements to docs (like this document) and adding test cases. As the system grows, having good tests for agents (perhaps using simulated tasks) will be crucial to avoid regressions. If you create a new agent, include a test scenario for it if possible.


🎨 Frontend/UX: If you have skills in UI/UX, feel free to enhance the frontend. This could be better visualizations of agent processes, more interactive controls, or theming support. If you have ideas to make the UI more intuitive for new users, discuss or implement them!


Before contributing, please make sure to follow the project’s code style guidelines and test your changes. We use conventional commit messages and require DCO sign-off (Developer Certificate of Origin) for contributions. Contributors are expected to adhere to the code of conduct as well.
